## Introduction

This application was created among JavaScript Udemy Course by Jonas Schmedtmann. However, there were a few functionalities added - creating own account and logging out.

## Basic functionality description

You may log in with couple of usernames and passwords stated below. Creating your own account is also possible, but bear in mind that only one account may be created at once. After logging in, page displays all deposits and withdrawals related to account. In case of own created account, a random array of deposits is generated. Other, precreated accounts have deposits and withdrawals hardcoded. Besides list displaying account movements there are three functions, transfer, loan request and closing account. Transfer is useful to sending money to other existing accounts, while loan request will grant deposit from bank in its amount which cant exceed 10% of highest deposit. Closing account function deletes currents user account. At the bottom of the page there are also totals of deposits, withdrawals and interest together with button for sorting out the movements descending.
